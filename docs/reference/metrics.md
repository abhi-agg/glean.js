## all-pings

These metrics are sent in every ping.

All Glean pings contain built-in metrics in the [`ping_info`](https://mozilla.github.io/glean/book/user/pings/index.html#the-ping_info-section) and [`client_info`](https://mozilla.github.io/glean/book/user/pings/index.html#the-client_info-section) sections.

In addition to those built-in metrics, the following metrics are added to the ping:
