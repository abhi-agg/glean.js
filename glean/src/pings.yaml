  description: |
    This ping is submitted when a user opts out of
    sending technical and interaction data to Mozilla.
    This ping is intended to communicate to the Data Pipeline
    that the user wishes to have their reported Telemetry data deleted.
    As such it attempts to send itself at the moment the user
    opts out of data collection.

  send_if_empty: true

  reasons:
    at_init: |
      The ping was submitted at startup.
      Glean discovered that between the last time it was run and this time,
      upload of data has been disabled.
    set_upload_enabled: |
      The ping was submitted between Glean init and Glean shutdown.
      Glean was told after init but before shutdown that upload has changed
      from enabled to disabled.

events:
  description: |
    The events ping's purpose is to transport event metric information.

    This ping is sent at startup if there are any events
    from the previous application run in storage.
    It is also sent when maximum capacity is hit
    i.e. when a given number of events is in storage.
    Maximum capacity defaults to 1,
    but may be changed through the `maxEvents` configuration option.

  reasons:
    startup: |
      The ping was submitted at startup.
      The events ping is always sent if there are any pending events at startup,
      because event timestamps are not as reliable across application runs.
    max_capacity: |
      The maximum number of events was reached (default 1 event).
    inactive: |
      The ping was submitted when becoming inactive. In earlier versions, this
      was called `background`.

      NOTE: It is not possible to find a definition of "inactivity" that spans
      all of the platforms served by the Glean JavaScript SDK.
      This reason is only listed here for documentation purposes.
      It is never reported by the JavaScript SDK.
